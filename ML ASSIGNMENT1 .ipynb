    "ANS.4 AI (Artificial Intelligence): AI is a broad field that focuses on creating intelligent machines that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as language processing, visual perception, decision-making, and problem-solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "ML (Machine Learning): ML is a subset of AI that involves training machines to learn patterns and make predictions from data, without being explicitly programmed to do so. ML algorithms are designed to automatically improve their performance with experience, and are commonly used in applications such as fraud detection, recommendation systems, and image recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "DL (Deep Learning): DL is a type of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers to analyze complex data structures, such as images, videos, and speech. DL algorithms are capable of learning from large amounts of data, and are often used in applications such as natural language processing, speech recognition, and autonomous vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "DS (Data Science): DS is an interdisciplinary field that combines statistical and computational methods to extract insights and knowledge from data. DS involves a range of tasks, including data cleaning and preparation, exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, machine learning, and data visualization.\n",

    "#What are the main differences between supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS.5 Supervised Learning: Supervised learning involves training a model using labeled data, where the input data and corresponding output values are provided to the model. The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping between the input and output variables, so that the model can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. Supervised learning algorithms include regression and classification models, and are commonly used in applications such as image recognition, fraud detection, and natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised Learning: Unsupervised learning involves training a model on unlabeled data, where the input data does not have corresponding output values. The goal of unsupervised learning is to identify patterns and relationships within the data, and group similar data points together. Unsupervised learning algorithms include clustering and dimensionality reduction models, and are commonly used in applications such as customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semi-Supervised Learning: Semi-supervised learning is a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning, where a model is trained on both labeled and unlabeled data. The goal of semi-supervised learning is to leverage the additional unlabeled data to improve the accuracy of the model on labeled data, and to learn more about the underlying structure of the data. Semi-supervised learning algorithms include label propagation and self-training models, and are commonly used in applications such as sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and image classification.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS.5 The training set is used to train the model on the data, while the test set is used to evaluate the performance of the model on unseen data. The validation set is used to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.\n",

    "The importance of each term in the split is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Training set: The training set is used to train the machine learning model on the data. The model learns from the patterns in the data to make predictions. The more data the model has to learn from, the better it will perform. The training set is crucial to the success of the model because it provides the foundation for the model's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test set: The test set is used to evaluate the performance of the model on unseen data. This is important because the model's ultimate goal is to make accurate predictions on new data that it has never seen before. If the model performs well on the test set, it is a good indication that it will perform well on new data.\n"
